NIACtool is an information collector to Nutanix cluster (AHV/ESXi) programmed in Python. NIACtool uses the API provided by Nutanix for the creation of a document that displays all the elements that make up the Nutanix HCI solution. It currently supports Nutanix with AHV and VMware hypervisor. By using AHV it is possible to get more information from the platform. The result is a document in excel format with all the necessary information for a correct visualization of your Nutanix platform.
